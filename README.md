# Speech Processing and Analysis
This repository contains a project on speech signal processing and analysis, conducted as part of an assignment to gain hands-on experience with audio signal processing using Python. The primary focus is on analyzing a recorded speech signal to understand its frequency components, as well as the effects of varying sampling frequencies and window lengths on frequency resolution.

## Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a speech signal to explore various aspects of audio processing, such as:

The impact of sampling frequency on spectrum resolution.
The effect of window length on frequency resolution.
Identification of dominant frequencies and fundamental frequency in speech.
Visualization of the speech signal and its periodograms.
This project serves as a foundation for understanding how audio signals can be processed and analyzed, with applications in fields like telecommunications, biomedical engineering, and artificial intelligence.
